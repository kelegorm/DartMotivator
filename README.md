DartMotivator
=============

Dart web application example.

It is a single page application with motivation advices. There is only two actions on the page: next advice and open a editor to file new advise. 

Project written on Dart with Polymer. [Try it](http://kelegorm.github.io/DartMotivator).

Right now it works with mock data, but it works with [NP-1-Motivator](https://github.com/kelegorm/NP-1-Motivator).
